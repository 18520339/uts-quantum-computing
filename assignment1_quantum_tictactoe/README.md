## I. How the Game is Played

In this game, 2 players `X` and `O` are represented by 2 qubit classical states, $|1\rangle$ and $|0\rangle$ respectively. Therefore, the **Pauli-X** gate is used to flip $|0\rangle$ to $|1\rangle$ for player `X`, while the **Identity gate** represents player `O`'s unchanged state $|0\rangle$. Players can choose between making a **classical** move or **quantum** move, leading to a range of possibilities upon measurement:

1. **Classical Move**: Each player alternates turns, placing their marker `X` or `O` on **1 unoccupied cell**.
2. **SWAP Move**: Apply the **SWAP** gate swap the states of **2 occupied cells** without adding new markers.
3. **Superposition**: Apply the **Hadamard** (H) gate to **1 unoccupied cell** (qubit), resulting in the $|+\rangle = \frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ state, which does not commit to `X` or `O` until the board is measured and collapsed.
4. **Entanglement**: Link **2 or 3 unoccupied cells**, affecting outcomes such that the final state of one cell will affect the other. Players must also carefully choose between **4 Risk Levels** (see below) based on their current position and potential future board states. Lower levels allow more controlled outcomes, while higher ones can gamble for a win or potentially aid the opponent.

The `X?` and `O?` markers will be used to indicate the cells are **superposed**/**entangled**, meaning their final values as `X` or `O` are not yet determined until a **measurement collapses** their states and capture the state with the **highest occurrence**. This can happen when:
- The board is **full**. If there are still several `X?`/`O?` cells, an **automatic collapse** will be performed to resolve all **superpositions**.
- Reaching a set of **superposed**/**entangled** cells forming a potential **winning line**.
- Manually triggered by the **Collapse** button press.

**[NOTE]**:
- If the board is **full** with no cells in **superposition** and also no winning lines, the game is `Draw`.
- If you want to make a new choice for **Entanglement Risk Levels**, just click the **Entanglement** button again.

## II. Ensure Fairness and Demonstrate a grasp of Quantum Concepts

In the beginning, this game only has 3 options: **Classical move**, **Superposition**, and **Entanglement** with the standard Bell state $|\Phi^+\rangle$. However, this **Entanglement** approach has 2 disadvantages.

- **Firstly**, when players select **Entanglement** and pick 2 cells on the board, this will be unfair for their opponents as they will lose 1 move.

- **Secondly**, the **Bell** state $|\Phi^+\rangle$ represents a maximally entangled state where measurement outcomes are perfectly correlated ($|00\rangle$ or $|11\rangle$). This strategy can be risky as it could lead to either a winning line quicker or accidentally help the opponent. For example, if `X` players have a plan of entangling 2 consecutive cells, they can have:
    - Multiple `X` in a row, increasing their possibility of winning.
    - Multiple `O` in a row, putting them at risk of losing as their `O` opponents now have more consecutive cells than them.

**Therefore, to overcome these**:
- I introduce the **SWAP Move**, which can disrupt existing lines or defenses in the opponent's strategy, limiting players from overusing **Entanglement** to dominate the game unfairly.
- Moreover, I introduce **4 Entanglement Risk Levels** to add strategic depth and require players to think critically about the consequences of their quantum moves:
    - By adding a **Pauli-X** gate before the **CNOT**'s target qubit, I turned the Bell state $|\Phi^+\rangle$ into $|\Psi^+\rangle$, which also represents a maximally entangled state but with opposing outcomes, ensuring a 50/50 chance and reducing the above risk of $|\Phi^+\rangle$.
    - Similarly, I further employed the same approach for **Triple Entanglement** and turn the **Standard |GHZ⟩** state into **|GHZ_Xs⟩** by applying 2 additional **Pauli-X** before the **CNOT** chains of **2 targeted** qubit components.

## III. Entanglement Risk Levels

There are 2 types of **Entanglements** in this game associated with 4 corresponding **Risk Levels**:

- **Pairwise Entanglement**: A player can entangle **2** empty cells, meaning the state of 1 cell depends on the state of the other, and their final states (either `X`or `O`) aren't determined until a measurement is performed.
- **Triple Entanglement**: Advanced moves allow entangling **3** cells simultaneously.

## V. Future Improvements

- Limit the **Entanglement Risk Levels** based on the board size. For example, **3x3** board can only use **PAIRWISE** entanglement (Level `1` & `3`). Because if they use `2` or `4`, they can win or lose the game in 1 move.
- Count the number of **winning lines** for each player as a score to demonstrate how confident the winner is or to determine the winner if the game is a **draw**.
- Apply phase shift gates like **S** or **T** gates before making a move. This could affect the probability **amplitudes** of the states, creating **interference** patterns in probabilities.
- Implement the `Undo` and `Redo` functionalities for the game. But this is a bit complex for cases like entanglement or after collapsing.
- Develop an `AI` opponent that adaptively uses quantum strategies, learning from the player's moves.
